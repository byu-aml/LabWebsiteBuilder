The Applied Machine Learning Lab at Brigham Young University focuses on various aspects of Computer Science research, with recent work in Natural Language Processing, Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, and Metalearning.  Our current research projects include [Topic Modeling (w/UMD)](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/projects/IIS-1409287.html) and [Metalearning](https://www.darpa.mil/program/data-driven-discovery-of-models).  We're very grateful to our sponsors, the [NSF Foundation](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1409739) and [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/program/data-driven-discovery-of-models).

Dr. Seppi received his B.S. in Computer Science from Brigham Young University in 1982 and his M.S. from Santa Clara University in 1987. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin in 1990 on a resident study fellowship from IBM. He returned to IBM following his Ph.D. work, and worked with IBM until 1995 when he joined BMC Software. Dr. Seppi joined the BYU Computer Science faculty in the fall of 2002.
